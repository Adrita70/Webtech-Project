            Valorant is a free-to-play first-person 
            hero shooter developed and published by 
            Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. Valorant 
            is one of those Counter Strike type of games 
            but playing a group of preset characters with 
            their unique abilities. I would say Valorant is 
            pretty solid in terms of gunplay and balanced abilities, 
            the abilities are the only new aspect of the game which 
            are mostly about defending, distractions and front assault.
            Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in 
            the near future.Players play as one of a set of
             Agents, characters designed based on several countries and 
             cultures around the world.In the main game mode, players 
             are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with 
             each team having five players on it. <br><br>

            Dota 2 has a large esports scene, with teams from around the world playing in various professional leagues 
            and tournaments. Valve manages an event format known as the Dota Pro Circuit, a series of tournaments that 
            award qualification points for earning direct invitations to The International, the game's premier annual 
            tournament. Internationals feature a crowdfunded prize money system that has seen amounts in upwards of 
            US$40 million, making Dota 2 the most lucrative esports game. Media coverage of most tournaments is done by 
            a selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches, similar to 
            traditional sporting events. In addition to playing live to audiences in arenas and stadiums, broadcasts 
            of them are also streamed over the internet and sometimes simulcast on television networks, with peak 
            viewership numbers in the millions.

            <p>
            The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different 
            objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb 
            while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages 
            that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes, all of which have distinct 
            characteristics specific to that mode.Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, 
            is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams, the Terrorists and the 
            Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to repeatedly complete objectives, such as securing a location
             to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or capturing hostages.

            <p>
            League of Legends, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video 
            game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for 
            Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.League of Legends 
            received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production 
            value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews trending positively; 
            the negative and abusive in-game behavior of its players, criticized since early in the game's 
            lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem.

           <h3>Apex Legends</h3>

            </a>
            <p>
            Apex Legends is set in the same science fiction universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall 
            series, with several characters from the Titanfall series appearing either as minor characters 
            or playable Legends. Work on the game began around late 2016, though the project remained a secret 
            right up until its launch. The game's release in 2019 came as a surprise, as until that point it had 
            been assumed that Respawn Entertainment was working on a third installment to the Titanfall franchise, 
            the studio's previous major game.
